== DSS eVote

eVote is a simple voting application: anybody can create a survey, which can
then be linked to eligible voters, who can vote before the deadline. It
includes integration with DSS Rights Management for people management, though
the authentication/user scheme can be swapped easily, and is able to e-mail
users, both to let them know to vote, when a vote is running out (if they still
haven't voted), and to let the creator of the poll know that it's over.

== Deployment
DSS eVote is a standard Rails 3 application. Assuming familiarity with Rails,
simply:

  bundle install (to get any missing gems)
  rake db:migrate (to create the database)
  (deploy, using Apache or your preferred server)
